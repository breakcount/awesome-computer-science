## Reverse Engine

- [Tutorial]
	- [Book](https://github.com/DennisYurichev/RE-for-beginners#readme) - "Reverse Engineering for Beginners" free book http://beginners.re
- [PE]
	- [code](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve) - [PE-sieve](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve) - PE-sieve is a light-weight tool that helps to detect malware running on the system, as well as to collect the potentially malicious material for further analysis. Recognizes and dumps variety of implants within the scanned process: replaced/injected PEs, shellcodes, hooks, and other in-memory patches.
Detects inline hooks, Process Hollowing, Process Doppelg√§nging, Reflective DLL Injection, etc.

- [Triton](https://triton.quarkslab.com/)
	- [code](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton) - [Triton](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton) - Triton is a Dynamic Binary Analysis (DBA) framework. It provides internal components like a Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) engine, a Taint Engine, AST representations of the x86 and the x86-64 instructions set semantics, SMT simplification passes, an SMT Solver Interface and, the last but not least, Python bindings.
	- [code](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Tigress_protection) - [Tigress_protection](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Tigress_protection) - Playing with the Tigress binary protection. Break some of its protections and solve some of its challenges. Automatic deobfuscation using symbolic execution, taint analysis and LLVM.
